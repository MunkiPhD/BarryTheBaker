# Barry The Baker
This is my implementation for the problem space here: https://github.com/MunkiPhD/baker-biz

As I generate the business requirements for my teams, I will work on the implementations here.

Intro: Basic refactoring of the initial code

Requirement #1: add cinnamon (optional), 1 tsp per pie. Once cinnamon is exhausted, you just make pies without it

Requirement #2: They forgot to tell us that apple pies require butter! we need 6 tbsp per pie. There are 8 tbsp in a stick, and when we ask the user, they will give us the number of sticks of butter they have on hand.

Requirement #3: Since it sells out every time, Barry the Baker has decided to make blueberry cobbler a staple in the shop. The recipe is:
  4 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)
  1 lemon zest
  5 tablespoons butter
  1 cup all-purpose flour
  1 cup granulated sugar
  1 cup milk
  1 tsp ground cinnamon
